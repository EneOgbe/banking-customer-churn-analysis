# banking-customer-churn-analysis
## Business Context
Customer churn is a critical challenge in retail banking, directly impacting revenue and long-term customer value.
This project explores customer churn risk using simulated retail banking data provided as part of a Lloyds Banking Group job simulation on Forage.

The objective is to identify behavioural and engagement patterns that may indicate increased churn risk and to derive insights that could support targeted customer retention strategies.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of simulated retail banking data across multiple tables, including:
- Customer demographics
- Transaction history
- Online and digital engagement activity
- Customer service interactions
- Churn status (target variable)

All datasets are linked using a unique CustomerID.

## Tools & Skills
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Data visualisation (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Business-focused analytical reasoning
